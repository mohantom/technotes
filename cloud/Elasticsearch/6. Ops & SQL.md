# Operations

## Shards
- Number of shards: need more primary if writes heavy
- You can't add more shards later without re-indexing. Overallocate a little. Scale in phases.
- Read-heavy apps can add more shards without re-indexing
```shell script
PUT /new_index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 10, # master
    "number_of_replicas": 1 # total nodes = 10 * 2 = 20
  }
}

GET /new_index/_settings
```

## Index
- make new index to hold new data, search both indices, use index alias "logs_current", "last_3_months"
- Lifecycle: Hot - warm (not updated) - cold (not queried frequently) - delete
```shell script
PUT _ilm/policy/datastream_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_size": "50GB",
            "max_age": "30d"
          }         
        } 
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }   
    }
  }
}

PUT _template/datastream__template
{
  "index_patterns": ["datastream_*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 1,
    "index.lifecycle.name": "datastream_policy",
    "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "datastream"
  }
}
```
static settings can't be changed: number_of_shards, codec
- grouping, splitting, shrinking, rollup (archive?)


## Hardware
- RAM is the bottleneck.
64GB per machine is the sweet spot (32GB for ES, 32GB for cache for lucene). <8GB is not recommended.
- SSD, RAID0, don't use NAS
- CUP not that important
- fast network
- Heap size default is 1GB. 
```shell script
export ES_HEAP_SIZE=10G  # or
ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms10g -Xmx10g" ./bin/elasticsearch  # don't cross 32GB! poiters blow up then
```

## Monitoring
- Now included in ES
- Security, monitoring, alerting, reporting, graph, ML
- Some are not free. 
- Monitoring is free. Enable it in Kibana

## SQL
new in ES6.3+. Indices are tables. There are some limitations.
```shell script
POST /_xpack/sql?format=txt
```

## Snapshots
backup indexes
```shell script
PUT _snapshot/backup-repo/snapshot-1
GET _snapshot/backup-repo/snapshot-1
GET _snapshot/backup-repo/snapshot-1/_status

# restore
POST /_all/_close
POST _snapshot/backup_repo/snapshot-1/_restore
```

## Rolling restarts
ex, version updates
1. Stop indexing, disable shard allocation
2. Shut down one node, perform maintenance, rejoin cluster
3. Wait cluster to return green. Repeat 1-3
4. Resume indexing and shard allocation
```shell script
PUT _cluster/settings   # stop shard allocation
{
  "trasient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"  # all
  }
}
```

## Search profiling
troubleshooting slow queries: capture logs, search profiling (large overhead)

## Uptime monitoring with Heartbeat

## Elasticsearch on AWS
- Main difference is security
- Integrate with Kinesis Firehose: stream data into ES in near real-time

1. Cretae domain (dev)...

## Elastic Cloud
- Elastic's hosted solution, built on top of aws
- Includes x-pack (simplify security), simpler setup ui
- Cost extra
