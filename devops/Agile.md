# Agile

## Continuous Delivery
Agile manifesto
	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

Releasing frequently
1.	Build the right thing
- Build the minimum viable thing
2.	Reduce risk of release
- Real project progress
- Done: live in production (Done done)

Everyone commits to the mainline every day
Build quality in - Deming
Test is not done after dev, it should be done during dev.
Everyone is responsible for quality, not only testers/QA
