Cucumber
==========

- plugin: Natural
- chrome plugin: tidy gherkin; 
- DataTable data, data.raw(); 
- parameterized variable with Examples; 
- @RegTest, @SmokeTest, @SanityTest, @MobileTest => 
- CucumberOptions(tags="@SmokeTest"); 
- Background keywork, in feature file similar to @BeforeEach; 
- @Before("@MobileTest") => remove Background section;
- dryRun=true (do not run test, only check if all features are implemented), monochrome=true (for pretty printing output), 
- restrict=true (to check missing implementation); 
- mvn test (need surefire plugin)


Cucumber Terminologies
-------------------------
What is Gherkin? 
 It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language  that lets you describe software's behavior.
Example: Pop up messaged is displayed when buttons are clicked and errors are gone	

Keywords Used in Cucumber: Scenario, Feature, Feature file, Scenario outline, Step Definition

## Scenarios:
In Cucumber Testcases are represented as Scenarios.
Scenarios contain Steps which are equivalent to test Steps and use the following keywords (Gherkin syntax) to denote them: Given, When, Then, But, and And (case sensitive).
- Given: Preconditions are mentioned in the Given keyword
- When: The purpose of the When Steps is to describe the user action.
- Then: The purpose of Then Steps is to observe the expected output. The observations should be related to the business value/benefit of your Feature description.

When we specify a business requirement, sometimes there are multiple pre-conditions, user actions, and expected outcomes

we are going to add one more Scenario and will use the And and But keywords:

- And: This is used for statements that are an addition to the previous Steps and represent positive statements.
- But: This is used for statements that are an addition to previous Steps and represent negative statements.



## Feature and Feature File:
Feature represents Business requirement.
Feature File acts as a Test Suite which consists of all Scenarios.

In Cucumber, Feature files contain Scenarios. We can simply create feature file with `feature` extension
Scenarios belonging to specific area of Application will be grouped into one Feature file

The text that immediately follows the Feature keyword, and is in the same line, is the Title of the Feature file
 Feature file should contain either Scenario or Scenario Outline. The naming conventions for Feature files should be lowercase with. feature extension 

```shell script
 Feature: Credit card payment
  In order to test Credit Card Payment functionality
  As a CC user
  I want to complete the payment through online

      Scenario: Make Minimum Due payment 
        Given user is on Pay credit card page
        Then user fills all details and select Minimum amount option
        And User clicks on Pay button
        Then Credit Card confirmation page is displayed
    
      Scenario: Pay Statement Balance 
        Given user is on Pay credit card page
        Then user fills all details and select Statement Balance option
        And User clicks on Pay button
        Then Credit Card confirmation page is displayed
    
    
      Scenario: Enter another Amount as 0
        Given user is on Pay credit card page
        Then user fills all details and select other Amount and enter 0
        And User clicks on Pay button
        Then Credit Card confirmation page is not displayed
        But error message is displayed
```
