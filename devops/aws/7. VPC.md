VPC & Subnets Primer 
====================

- VPC: private network to deploy your
resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your
network inside your VPC
(Availability Zone resource)
- A public subnet is a subnet that is
accessible from the internet
- A private subnet is a subnet that is not
accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and
between subnets, we use Route Tables


### NACL (Network ACL)
- A firewall which controls traffic from and tosubnet
- Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
- Are attached at the Subnet level
- Rules only include IP addresses

###Security Groups
- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
- Can have only ALLOW rules
- Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

- Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
- NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
- NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
- Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
- VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, non transitive
