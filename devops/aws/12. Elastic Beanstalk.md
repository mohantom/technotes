Elastic Beanstalk
===============
developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS, free

### Elastic Beanstalk has three components
- Application
- Application version: each deployment gets assigned a version
- Environment name (dev, test, prod…): free naming



### Elastic Beanstalk Under the Hood
- Under the hood, Elastic Beanstalk relies on CloudFormation
- CloudFormation is used to provision other AWS services (we’ll see later)
- Use case: you can define CloudFormation resources in your .ebextensions
to provision ElastiCache, an S3 bucket, anything you want!
