EC2
=======
- create EC2 free instance

## SSH
- Putty: download pem file, convert to ppk file that putty can use
- Win10 (cmd or Powershell): 
    - `ssh -i "D:\AWS\AWS developer\EC2Tutotorial.pem" ec2-user@34.207.194.139`
    - change pem file security (right click file)

- EC2 instance connect (from EC2 console in browser, only works on Amazon Linux 2)

## Security groups
must have to SSH, HTTP

## private, public and elastic IP
public IP will change if instance restarts, BUT private IP does not change. 
 
Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP (has $ cost):
- They often reflect poor architectural decisions
- Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
- Or, as we’ll see later, use a Load Balancer and don’t use a public IP
```
ifconfig -a
```

## Install Apache
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd.x86_64
systemctl start httpd.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
curl localhost:80
# add HTTP to security group, then go to browser http://34.207.194.139

echo "Hello World from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

## EC2 User Data
bootstrap ec2 instance
new instance -> configure instance / Advanced Details
copy cmd from `Intall Apache`

## EC2 Instance Launch Types
- On Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing
- Reserved: (MINIMUM 1 year)
- Reserved Instances: long workloads
- Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
- Scheduled Reserved Instances: example – every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm
- Spot Instances: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
    Great combo: Reserved Instances for baseline + On-Demand & Spot for peaks
- Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware
- Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement

## Elastic Network interfaces
for fail over
- create own ENI
- attach to instances

## Summary
The best way to know the pricing is to consult the pricing page:
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/

It may be daunting to choose the right instance type (there are over 50 of them) - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- https://ec2instances.info/ can help with summarizing the types of instances
- R/C/P/G/H/X/I/F/Z/CR are specialised in RAM, CPU, I/O, Network, GPU
- M instance types are balanced
- T2/T3 instance types are “burstable”
