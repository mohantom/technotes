AWD CloudFormation
==================
infrastructure as code

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS
Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
- I want a security group
- I want two EC2 machines using this security group
- I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
- I want an S3 bucket
- I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the
exact configuration that you specify
