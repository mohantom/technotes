ELB + ASG
==========

## Why use a load balancer? 
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application 
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances 
- Do regular health checks to your instances 
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites 
- Enforce stickiness with cookies 
- High availability across zones 
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

### Classic Load Balancer (v1)
- Supports TCP (Layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS (Layer 7)
- Health checks are TCP or HTTP based
- Fixed hostname XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com


### Application Load Balancer (v2)
- Routing tables to different target groups:
- Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
- Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
- Routing based on Query String, Headers
(example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
- ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
- In comparison, we’d need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application


### Network Load Balancer (v2)
- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
    - Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
    - Handle millions of request per seconds
    - Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
- NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP
(helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
- NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
- Not included in the AWS free tier

### Load Balancer Stickiness
- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected
to the same instance behind a load balancer
ALB -> Target -> Stickiness -> enable

cross zone LB is enabled by default for ALB, but not for CLB or NLB

### SSL/TLS
 SSL – Server Name Indication (SNI)
- SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
- It’s a “newer” protocol, and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
- The server will then find the correct certificate, or return the default one

Note:
- Only works for ALB & NLB (newer
generation), CloudFront
- Does not work for CLB (older gen)

ALB -> `Listeners`

### ELB – Connection Draining
- Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
- Stops sending new requests to the instance which is de-registering


### Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
use template
it will also create EC2 instances and LB
