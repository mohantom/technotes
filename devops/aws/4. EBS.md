Elastic Block Store
===================

## EBS Volume
- It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
    - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of
    latency
    - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
    - An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
    - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
    - You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
    - You can increase the capacity of the drive over time


## EFS – Performance & Storage Classes
- EFS Scale
    - 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput
    - Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically
- Performance mode (set at EFS creation time)
    - General purpose (default): latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc…)
    - Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
- Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature – move file after N days)
    - Standard: for frequently accessed files
    - Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
