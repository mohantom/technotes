Relational Database Service (RDS)
===============================

## RDS
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
    - Postgres
    - MySQL
    - MariaDB
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)


RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

## Amazon Aurora
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your
drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement
over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
- Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process
is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It’s HA (High Availability) native.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient


## Amazon ElastiCache Overview
- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases…
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low
latency
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- Helps make your application stateless
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup,
configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
- Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes


- Redis: Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability; backup and restore features
- Memcached: multi-node for partitional of data (sharding), no persistent, no backup and restore
