AWS CLI
========

## Cli configure
- IAM -> users -> select user -> Security credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key
- $ aws configure

on EC2 instance: use IAM roles instead (do not use $ aws configure)
- create a new role from IAM
- attach it to the ec2 instance


IAM: create custom policy and attach it to a role
to test it: AWS policy simulator, or use cli with `--dry-run`
add policy `RunInstances`, `STS decode message...`


## STS decode
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/decode-authorization-message.html


## EC2 instance metadata
- AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is powerful but one of the least known features to developers
- It allows AWS EC2 instances to ”learn about themselves” without using an IAM Role for that purpose.
- The URL is [http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/]
- You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you CANNOT retrieve the IAM Policy.
- Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
- Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instance


## CLI profile
for multiple AWS accounts
```shell script
aws configure --profile my-other-aws-account
```
## MFA
multi-factor authentication


## AWS SDK
boto3: aws sdk in python


exponential backoff (retry): wait 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... seconds

## AWS Credentials Best Practices
- Overall, NEVER EVER STORE AWS CREDENTIALS IN YOUR CODE
- Best practice is for credentials to be inherited from the credentials chain
- If using working within AWS, use IAM Roles
    - => EC2 Instances Roles for EC2 Instances
    - => ECS Roles for ECS tasks
    - => Lambda Roles for Lambda functions
- If working outside of AWS, use environment variables / named profiles


You should sign an AWS HTTP request using Signature v4 (SigV4)
