ECS, ECR & Fargate - Docker
===============================
ECR: elastic container registry (private)
vs docker hub (public)

ECS cluster
IAM

## ECS task definition
json to tell ECS how to run docker container
configure from UI -> generate json

## ECS Service
configure UI. similar to MS OneUI
scale instances

## ECS Service with load balancer
dynamic port forwarding (leave host port as blank in ECS task definition)
load balancer can only be created during service definition

## Fargate
serverless, don't provision EC2 instances, just need task definition -> much simplier

## Binpack

## Clsuter capacity provider
