Encryption

Section 4

## Symmetric encryption
algorithm (public): 
key (secret)

symmetric encryption uses only one key (password)
encrypt with AES256 and password, then send password via email, text...

## Asymmetric encryption
uses 2 keys (public & private)
- RSA, ECC, DH, El Gamal

https uses two keys

slower than symmetric
1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys

=> hybrid (eg, TLS)

# Hash functions
authenticate senders, public keys
- MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512, Tiger
- HMAC: hash-based message authentication code

## Digital signatures
sender -> hash algo -> hash value -> sender private key -> signed message

## SSL, TLS
SSL: secure sockets layer (older)
TLS: transport layer security (new), used in https, most used 

## End to end encryption (E2EE)
ZRTP, OTR, SSL/TLS, PGP
use it wherever possible

## Steganography
conceal messages or information in other non-secret text or data
not obvious way in contract to encryption
