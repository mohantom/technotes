[Web Developer Security Checklist V2](https://www.sensedeep.com/blog/posts/stories/web-developer-security-checklist.html)

## Script injection
sql, nosql

## Cross-site scripting XSS
- dynamic
- permanent: script saved in post, executed to stole data (eg, credit card)

## Cross-site request forgery CSRF
- forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web app in which they are currently authenticated
- attacker does not see response data that used for state-changing requests, unless also vulnerable to XSS
- specific for cookies

CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing

- store session on server (use cookies): use http only flag to avoid XSS, but still vulnerable to CSRF
- store session on client (no cookies): vulnerable to XSS

- GET should always be idempotent and not be state-changing
- Attacks with POST/PUT/DELETE still possible, but much less likely
- Re-authentication: captcha, password
- Unique form tokens generated on every POST/PUT/DELETE request, include token in both cookie header and body
