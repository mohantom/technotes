Java basic
============

## encapsulation, inheritance, polyphorphism, abstraction

Can static method be inherited? Yes, but it can't be overridden. It belongs to superclass, subclass can have the same
static method, but different function

```shell script

Single s1 = Single.getInstance();
	// 懒汉式
	class Single	{
		private static Single s = null;
		private Single(){}

		public static Single getInstance() {	
          return s == null ? new Single() : s;		
        }
	}


public static Single getInstance() {     //提高效率, 不需每次判断
   if(s == null) {
     synchronized (Single.class) {
       if(s == null) { 
        s = new Single()
       }
     }
   }
   

```

## Exception

- A "checked exception" needs to be handled.
- RuntimeException ClassCastException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, FileNotFoundException,
  ArithmeticException, IOException,

## ArrayList vs LinkedList

1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to
   store the elements.
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array,
   all the bits are shifted in memory. Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly
   linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only. LinkedList class can act as a list and
   queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

## Abstract vs Interface

1. Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
   From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2. Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final
   variables.
3. Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface has only
   static and final variables.
4. Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. Interface can’t provide the
   implementation of abstract class.
5. Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements” and abstract class can be
   extended using keyword “extends”.
6. Multiple implementation: An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can extend another
   Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
7. Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have
   class members like private, protected, etc.

## TCP vs UDP
Transmission control protocol (TCP)	
User datagram protocol (UDP)

TCP needs connection, reliable (guarantee delivery), error-checking, sequencing, slower, can retransmission, 20-80 bytes
variable length hader, heavy weight, no broadcasting, HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/SMTP  (vs UDP: DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, VoIP)
